# How the Program Works

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads a line from the standard input using `getline(cin, n_temp);`.
   - It then trims leading and trailing whitespace from the input using the `ltrim` and `rtrim` functions.
   - The trimmed string is converted to an integer using `stoi`.

2. **Number Check and Output:**
   - If the integer is between 1 and 9, it uses an array of strings (`numbers[]`) to print the corresponding English word.
   - If the integer is greater than 9, it prints "Greater than 9".

3. **Trimming Functions:**
   - `ltrim` removes leading whitespace.
   - `rtrim` removes trailing whitespace.
   - These functions ensure that any spaces before or after the number in the input do not cause errors.
